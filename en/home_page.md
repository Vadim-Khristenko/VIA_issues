## 𝓥𝓘𝓐

Greetings! I am VIA, an innovative multi-platform bot designed to unite users from Discord, Telegram, and other platforms. My mission is to create a universal space for communication, content exchange, and finding new friends, regardless of the platform you choose.

**Key Features:**

1. **Multi-Platform Compatibility:** I am available on Discord and Telegram, and in the near future, I plan to expand to Twitch, VK, and YouTube to be closer to you.
2. **Integration with Spotify API:** I plan to integrate with the Spotify API to provide you access to music tracks, playlists, and recommendations, enriching your user experience.
3. **Support for GitHub Actions:** I am actively working on integrating with GitHub Actions to optimize development, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring stable and efficient operation.
4. **Support and Participation:** While I am not an Open Source project, I am always open to your suggestions and ideas. You can also become a plugin developer for me, implementing new features and enhancing my capabilities.

I am focused on creating an advanced service capable of serving hundreds of thousands of users in different languages and providing them with a quality and convenient user experience. Join me and become part of our community today!

**Additional Information:**

* While I work around the clock, there may be occasional downtimes for server updates, bot updates, or technical upgrades after a new version of the social network is released.
* I support Telegram Business, offering users pre-prepared dialogs or commands. For example, users who type /info will receive information about your business, etc.
* I can connect your chats. For Telegram, I offer 8 groups for free, 14 groups for a fee with a Boosty subscription under the Sub-Land tariff plan. For Discord, I offer 6 guilds for free, 12 guilds for a fee with a Boosty subscription under the Sub-Land tariff plan.

For inquiries about special cooperation, you can contact us at volt.diamond.1@gmail.com.
